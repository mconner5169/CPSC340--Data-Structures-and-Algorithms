# Spell Checker

This program uses a binary search tree to spell check words entered by the user. The correct dictionary spelling of the words
are stored in the BST. For each word that needs to be checked, the program will search the tree to see if the word is stored. 
If it is, the word is spelled correctly. If not, the word is spelled incorrectly.
