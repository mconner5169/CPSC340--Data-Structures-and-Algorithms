# Class Schedule

This program uses Directed Acyclic Graphs and topological sorting. The objective of this project takes a list of courses and their 
pre-requisites as input, and prints out a topological ordering that one can take the courses in without violating any pre-requisites.
If the set of courses can not be taken in any order, you should print out that there is no way to take those courses.
