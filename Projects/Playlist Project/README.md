# Playlist Creator

This program uses and manipulates doubly linked lists, and creates a menu that allows users to add and remove songs from a playlist; 
print the number of songs in the playlist; shuffles and reverses the songs in the playlist; saves and loads songs from a .txt file.
The playlists are created by the user by inputting a song title and an artist.
